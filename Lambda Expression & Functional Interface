Benefits:
- To enable functional programming in java
- write more readable, maintainable & concise code
- To use APIs very easily and effectively
- To enable parallel processing

Functional programming is the mathematical way of solving a problem.

Syntax:
	Parameter -> Expression Body

Arrow operator is introduced in Java through Lambda expressions that divides it into two parts i.e. Parameters & Body

Functional Interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method
