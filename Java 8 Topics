1. Lambda Expressions
2. Functional Interfaces -- It can be used to call lambda expressions 
3. Default methods in Interface
4. Static Methods in Interfaces.
5. Predicate -- Pre-defined Functional Interface
6. Function -- Pre-defined Functional Interface
7. Consumer -- Pre-defined Functional Interface
8. Supplier 
9. Method Reference & Constructor Reference by Double Colon(::) Operator.
10. Stream API -- Operations on collections
11. Date & Time API ( Joda API)

Till Java 1.7 version, we can only declare public abstract methods and public static final variables inside an interface.
But from Java 1.8 version, we can declare concrete methods inside interfaces those are called default methods.
We can also declare static methods inside interfaces.

From Java 1.8 version, now interfaces can include default methods and static methods.

Benefits of Java 1.8
- To simplify programming
- To utilize Functional programming in the form of Lamdba Expression 
- To enable parallel programming or processing in the form of Streams

Method Reference
- Reference to a Static Method
- Reference to a Non Static Method
- Reference to a Contructor
